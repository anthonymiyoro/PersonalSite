title: CHANGING THE THEME OF YOUR PYCHARM IDE
date: 2016-02-01

 Are you tired of the default colour of your Jetbrains IDE? (I know I am!)

Head over to the [Color Themes](http://color-themes.com/?view=index)website and download your favourite theme.

Once downloaded, head to
```
File → Import Settings → Select the jar file
```
Restart Pycharm

If the color scheme isn’t applied automatically, go to
  ```
 File → Settings → Editor → Color & Fonts
  ```
and select the desired scheme
